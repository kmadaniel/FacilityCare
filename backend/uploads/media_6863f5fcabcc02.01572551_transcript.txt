 The question I'm asked is how do you read your script and look at the camera lens at the same time? Is this all about editing, memorizing a paragraph, shoot, read and memorize, and then edit? Here's how I do it. Actually, I do it one of two different ways depending on what I'm talking about. Wait number one, I just know what I'm going to say and then I say it. The problem with this is I like to ramble and it takes longer to edit. Wait number two, I just simply type out what I'm going to say before I say it. And then I say it one line at a time. When it's all edited, can you really tell?
